## Please reading before you use the code:
The data structure and algorithm in this repository follows the MIT , so anyone can use and rewrite it with clone. If you want to use someone in this repository , you need to read the class name, the functions name in the class , the parameters of the functions and the return of functions. Their names are very easy to understand. You just need to read them to know their functions, so that you can use them conveniently . After that, you only need to change the code at the end of some functions to meet your own needs. For example, at the end of the find_data function(if the class which you need has this function), I only print the results or 'find data' by print(). You need to write according to your own needs, such as changing to return.

In most of these codes, access key is used to access basic information of data structure and algorithm, and the default is adsf;{h3096j34ka\`fd>&/edgb^45:6. You can modify it in the corresponding decorator function. At the same time, many places have set up the class private function. If you don't understand its implementation, you don't need to read it.

However, most of these data structures and algorithms are written based on a special case, for example, only the large top heap is implemented in the heap.py, not the small top heap. If you need a small top heap, you need to make some changes to the code. Don't worry about that , there are many more detailed notes in the code, which can help you quickly understand the code and provide convenience for you to rewrite the code according to your needs.

If you have any questions when you use it, you are welcome to put forward the issue. If you need to, please feel free to @Fieldhunter at any time. If you have better suggestions or ideas to make the code more efficient, concise, or powerful, even adding some necessary notes or making better changes to existing notes,  feel free to send me a PR, I am always welcome to receive.
